To begin with heat oil in a pan over medium flame and add minced garlic along with red chili flakes and saute for 2 minutes. Take another pan, pour the water and bring it to a boil.

	<p><strong>2.</strong> Now add the peeled tomatoes, basil and parsley in the pan. Mix all the ingredients well and let it simmer for 10 minutes until the sauce starts to thicken. When the sauce starts gaining consistency, put off the burner and add salt and black pepper powder to the sauce. Keep the sauce warm.</p>
	<p><strong>3.</strong> Add the pasta over the warm sauce and toss with carefully. Serve it immediately. In fact, if you are someone who likes the cheesy version of pasta then you can garnish the pasta with some grated parmesan cheese and to make it more aromatic, you can dry roast a few basil leaves and crush it with some chilli flakes and oregano. This herb fusion will make your pasta even more delectable. Serve it with garlic bread and relish this delicious pasta recipe. </p>
