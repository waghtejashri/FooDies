	<h3><strong>Method</strong></h3>
	<p><strong>1.</strong> To make the pastry, mix the flour and icing sugar together in a bowl. Rub the butter into the flour with your fingertips until it resembles fresh breadcrumbs then mix in the egg yolks. If the pastry feels too dry to form a dough, add 2 tbsp water. Roll into a ball then flatten it out into a disc and wrap the dough in cling film, then chill for at least 30 mins</p>
	<p><strong>2.</strong> While the pastry is chilling, make the filling by simply mixing all of the ingredients together in a large jug or bowl. Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface to about the thickness of a Â£1 coin, then lift into a 23cm tart tin. Press down gently on the bottom and sides, then trim off any excess around the edges with a sharp knife. Prick the base of the pastry case with a fork and put it back in the fridge for 30 mins.</p>
	<p><strong>3.</strong> Heat oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. Line the tart with baking parchment that you've crumpled and re-smoothed, then put baking beans or rice on top to hold the paper down. Bake for 10 mins, then remove the tart tin from the oven. Lift out the baking beans and paper, and bake for another 20 mins until golden and crisp. </p>
	<p><strong>4.</strong> When the pastry is cooked, remove it from the oven, pour in the pineapple mixture almost all the way to the top but leaving a small gap and bake again for 25 mins or until just set.</p>
	<p><strong>5.</strong> Leave to cool, then remove the tart from the tin and put it in the fridge to chill for 30 mins. </p>
	<p><strong>6.</strong> While the tart cools pour the double cream and coconut rum into a large bowl and whisk until thick and billowy. Dollop the boozy cream on top of the tart and decorate with maraschino cherries and cocktail umbrellas if you like. </p>
